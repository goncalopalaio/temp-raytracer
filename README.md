# temp-raytracer
Quick raytracer experiment. Early stages.

Heavily inspired by:
[Ray Tracing in One Weekend by Peter Shirley Book 1](https://www.amazon.com/Ray-Tracing-Weekend-Minibooks-Book-ebook/dp/B01B5AODD8)

Cobbled together with some files from:
[Ctoy by anael-seghezzi](https://github.com/anael-seghezzi/CToy)
[Maratis-Tiny-C-library by Ctoy by anael-seghezzi](https://github.com/anael-seghezzi/Maratis-Tiny-C-library)
